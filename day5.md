Hi folks! Today‚Äôs topic is for the demographers and acturials out there:

Day 5Ô∏è‚É£ Mortality modelling

This is a topic I know the least about out of all topics but I got
interested from a chat with my colleague about an unified framework for
mortality modelling via:

üìâ Before any modelling, we ought to know more about the data source &
make exploratory graphics to study it

üë∂ A number of \#rstats pkgs download the human mortality data but I
ended up creating my own to source the data in a tidy form üòÖ

‚ö• They also say women live longer than men but is that also true?

I also heard that people in üáØüáµ live long.

üîç We can also have a look at some other statistics provided

Plotting the death rate and exposure to risk (which I‚Äôm not sure how
it‚Äôs measured), I can see why there‚Äôs a number of people in demography
who do research in functional analysis!

üéØ Let‚Äôs now get to some mortality modelling with {StMoMo} üì¶!

Most of what I know about mortality modelling comes from the talk at
@\_useRconf 2018 by @amvillegasr

You‚Äôll also learn about what the name {StMoMo} stands for!

Most well known mortality model is the Lee-Carter model, others are CBD,
M7, APC, etc.

ü§î So how are these models different?

üí° {StMoMo} defines models with `StMoMo::StMoMo` in a way that is easier
to see the difference compared to a recipe approach

# ingredients of the Lee-Carter model 
constLC <- function(ax, bx, kt, b0x, gc, wxt, ages) {
  c1 <- mean(kt[1, ], na.rm = TRUE)
  c2 <- sum(bx[, 1], na.rm = TRUE)
  list(ax = ax + c1 * bx, bx = bx / c2, kt =  c2 * (kt - c1))
}

LC <- StMoMo(link = "logit", staticAgeFun = TRUE, periodAgeFun = "NP",
             constFun = constLC)
LC
```

    ## Binomial model with predictor: logit q[x,t] = a[x] + b1[x] k1[t]

``` r
# above is the same as below
lc(link = "logit")

    ## Binomial model with predictor: logit q[x,t] = a[x] + b1[x] k1[t]

Using {StMoMo} you can easily get forecasts and diagnostic plots!

There‚Äôs more to this than I can explain.
