# Learn with me about *mortality modelling*

Hi folks! Today's topic is for the demographers and acturials out there:

Day 5️⃣  Mortality modelling

This is a topic I know the least about out of all topics but I got interested from a chat with my colleague about an unified framework for mortality modelling via:

Day 5️⃣ #1

📉 Before any modelling, we ought to know more about the data source & make exploratory graphics to study it

👶 A number of #rstats pkgs download the human mortality data but I ended up creating my own to source the data in a tidy form 😅

Day 5️⃣ #2

👵🏻 They say people are living longer but is that really true?

⚥ They also say women live longer than men but is that also true?

I also heard that people in  🇯🇵  live long.

I'm going to take a closer at the data in Australia 🇦🇺 and Japan 🇯🇵 to investigate 🔍

Day 5️⃣ #3

🔍 We can also have a look at some other statistics provided

Plotting the death rate and exposure to risk (which I'm not sure how it's measured), I can see why there's a number of people in demography who do research in functional analysis!

Day 5️⃣ #4

🎯 Let's now get to some mortality modelling with {StMoMo} 📦!

Most of what I know about mortality modelling comes from the talk at @_useRconf 2018 by @amvillegasr

You'll also learn about what the name {StMoMo} stands for!

Day 5️⃣ #5

Most well known mortality model is the Lee-Carter model, others are CBD, M7, APC, etc. 

🤔 So how are these models different?

💡 {StMoMo} defines models with `StMoMo::StMoMo` in a way that is easier to see the difference compared to a recipe approach

```{r lc-recipe}
library(StMoMo)
# ingredients of the Lee-Carter model 
constLC <- function(ax, bx, kt, b0x, gc, wxt, ages) {
  c1 <- mean(kt[1, ], na.rm = TRUE)
  c2 <- sum(bx[, 1], na.rm = TRUE)
  list(ax = ax + c1 * bx, bx = bx / c2, kt =  c2 * (kt - c1))
}

LC <- StMoMo(link = "logit", staticAgeFun = TRUE, periodAgeFun = "NP",
             constFun = constLC)
LC

# above is the same as below
lc(link = "logit")
```

```{r cbd-recipe}
library(StMoMo)
# ingredients of the CBD model 
f2 <- function(x, ages) x - mean(ages)

CBD <- StMoMo(link = "logit", staticAgeFun = FALSE,
       periodAgeFun = c("1", f2))
CBD

# above is the same as below
cbd()

Day 5️⃣ #6

Using {StMoMo} you can easily get forecasts and diagnostic plots!

There's more to this than I can explain.
