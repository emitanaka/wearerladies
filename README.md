# We are R-Ladies

This repo holds the scheduled twitter content for when I am the curator of the twitter account [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) during 2022 April 18th-23rd. Because I live in the AEST timezone, some of the day reference in tweets may be one day early for some folks. 

I'm going to cover 6 topics -- 4 of which I'm not an expert in and so I'll be learning along with everyone. I'll aim to share at least 2-3 tips/ideas/analysis per day. In particular, I'll share some approaches I've taken (which may or may not be the best practice!) or thoughts on certain parts of the topic.  

Please note that the contents will be available after the day has finished, so check out [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) if you want to see the contents first.

* **[Day 2](day2.md)**: Learn with me about *twitter analysis*
